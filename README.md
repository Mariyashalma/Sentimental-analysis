# Sentiment Analysis on iPhone 14 Customer Reviews

This project performs sentiment analysis on customer reviews of the iPhone 14 using deep learning models (CNN and LSTM). The application is built using **Streamlit** for deployment.

## Features
- Predict sentiment (Positive, Neutral, Negative) from text reviews.
- Choose between CNN and LSTM models.
- Uses a pre-trained tokenizer for text processing.
- Implements a keyword-based classification approach.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis.git
   cd sentiment-analysis
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure you have the trained models (`cnn_sentiment_model.h5` and `lstm_sentiment_model.h5`) and the tokenizer file (`tokenizer.json`) in the project directory.

## Running the Streamlit App

Run the following command:
```sh
streamlit run app.py
```
